Hardware components are the epicenter of our project. All the real-time data are collected on the hardware device and then transfered to the database.
The Hardware component used in our projects are:-
1. Node MCU with ESP-32 :- Connects to the internet and allows us to store data gathered in realtime.
2. MPU-9250 :- This is a 9-axis motion tracking device that can provide data on the device's orientation, acceleration, and angularÂ velocity.

### Introduction:
Rapidez is an IoT (Internet of Things) based mobile application that alerts users of excessive speed limits while they are driving. The app uses GPS technology and sensor data from connected devices to determine the speed of the vehicle and alert the driver if they exceed the legal speed limit.

### Use Case:
One of the main use cases of Rapidez is to promote safe driving and reduce the risk of accidents caused by excessive speed. The app can also be used by parents to monitor the driving habits of their teenage children and ensure they are driving safely. Additionally, the app can be used by law enforcement agencies to monitor and enforce speed limits in areas with high traffic volume.

### Novelity of Our project:
The novelty of Rapidez is its ability to integrate IoT technology with mobile applications to provide real-time speed monitoring and alerts. This allows for more accurate and efficient monitoring of speed limits, as well as the ability to customize alerts based on individual user preferences. The app also provides detailed analytics and reports on the driver's speed and driving habits, which can be used to improve driving behavior and reduce the risk of accidents.

### Usability: 
Rapidez is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. The app's interface is simple and straightforward, making it easy for users to understand and use. The app's alerts are also clear and easy to understand, providing users with the information they need to make informed decisions about their driving.

### Feasibility: 
The app's technology is based on existing GPS and sensor technology, which makes it a feasible solution for monitoring speed and alerting users of excessive speeds. The app's business model is also feasible, as it is based on a common freemium model that has been successful in many other industries.

### Uniqueness: 
Rapidez is unique in its ability to integrate IoT technology with mobile applications to provide real-time speed monitoring and alerts. This allows for more accurate and efficient monitoring of speed limits, as well as the ability to customize alerts based on individual user preferences. The app also provides detailed analytics and reports on the driver's speed and driving habits, which can be used to improve driving behavior and reduce the risk of accidents. Additionally, the app is unique in that it is able to target different demographics with tailored advertisements based on the user's driving habits.


### Business Model Of Our Application

Rapidez will operate on a freemium business model. The basic version of the app will be available for free and include the core features such as speed monitoring and alerts. However, users can opt to upgrade to a premium version of the app that includes additional features such as detailed analytics, customized alerts, and the ability to monitor multiple vehicles.

The premium version of the app will be available for a monthly or annual subscription fee. This revenue stream is the primary source of income for the company. Additionally, Rapidez may also generate revenue through partnerships with insurance companies, car manufacturers, and law enforcement agencies. These partnerships could involve the use of Rapidez's data and analytics to improve road safety and reduce insurance claims.

Another potential revenue stream for Rapidez is through targeted advertising. The app's ability to track and analyze driving habits can be used to target specific demographics with tailored advertisements. For example, an advertisement for a car rental service could be shown to a user who frequently travels long distances.

In summary, Rapidez's business model is based on offering a free core service with the option to upgrade to a premium version for additional features and benefits. The company generates revenue through subscription fees, partnerships, and targeted advertising.
